	  <h1> Research</h1>
	  <p> The main goal of our research group is to understand how light can be used to control 
	  chemistry. To that end, we develop theoretical methods based on quantum mechanics that can 
	  be used to simulate light-matter interactions within a computer. Some of our current interests are:

                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p> When a molecule is photo-ionized, the newly created hole quickly initiates a fast charge migration 
		    through the molecular backbone. This migration happens in femto- to sub-femtosecond time scales, preceding
		    any structural reorganization and is driven mainly by  electron correlation. The possible pathways in 
		    which hole migration takes place leads to eventual hole-density accumulation at specific sites in the
		    molecule, which coupled with nuclear motion, determines photochemical outcomes. Thus, being able to 
		    model ultrafast charge migration with high-level electronic structure methods with a reasonable
		    computational cost is an important step for a better understanding and control of phtochemistry.

                    <p> The interaction of molecules with high-intensity X-rays can lead to the formation of core-hole states, 
		    due to the ionization of core-electrons. These core-hole states are highly sensitive to their molecular 
		    environment, and thus, can be used as a probe for chemical change. Exploring how the formation of 
		    core-hole states affects the electronic structure of interesting molecular systems offers an invaluable 
		    opportunity to discover new spectroscopic signatures and spectroscopies.

                    <p> The interaction of molecules with electric fields in confined environments, such as in localized 
		    plasmons and optical cavities, can lead to a drastic change in the molecular electronic structure. 
		    Such changes can be large enough to promote new chemical reactions. An important step towards 
		    a better understanding of how these changes can be used to mediate new chemistry is the ability to 
		    perform computational simulations that go beyond the semi-classical treatment of electric fields in 
		    a reliable and inexpensive way.

                    <p> The accurate description of spectroscopic properties is of absolute importance in quantum 
		    chemistry and can only be consistently achieved through high-level electronic structure methods. 
		    Nonetheless, the elevated computational cost associated with these methods limits their applications

	<!--	    The interaction of matter with high-intensity electromagnetic fields in the UV-visible region is 
		    known to generate a plethora of interesting phenomena, such as high-harmonic generation and multi-photon 
		    absorption. With the advent of the second phase Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II), a new light 
		    source funded by the Department of Energy and due in the Fall of 2020, it will become possible to explore 
		    and probe the emergence of novel phenomena due to the interaction of molecules with strong fields generated
		    by focused X-ray laser beams. We wish to take this opportunity to develop new techniques based on 
		    time-dependent coupled-cluster and density functional theories to model diverse non-linear spectroscopies
		    and explore the emergence of new phenomena in molecular systems enabled by their interaction with 
		     intense  X-ray  pulses.  --!>
